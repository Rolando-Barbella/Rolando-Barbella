# 🏄🏼‍♂️ Rolando

A developer who gets thrilled from creating great, pleasing solutions that deliver user-friendly. Since I started programming with different tools and languages, I have focused my career on not just doing a job but delivering quality work, along with a  great interest in JavaScript/Typescript development with commercial experience in React Native, React JS, some NextJS, and Supabase.

I have been fortunate enough to have been involved in great projects that have allowed me to gain experience mainly in mobile, but also web environments.
