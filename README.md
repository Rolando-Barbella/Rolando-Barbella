# Hi there, I'm Rolando 

A developer who gets thrilled from creating great pleasing solutions that deliver user-friendly. Since I started programming with different tools and languages, I have focused my career on not just doing a job but delivering quality work, along with great interest in JavaScript/Typescript development with commercial experience in React Native, React JS, NextJS, Supabase, TailwindCSS and Node JS.

I have been fortunate enough to have been involved in great projects that have allowed me to gain experience in web, mobile, and desktop environments.
