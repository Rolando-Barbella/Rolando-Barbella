# Hi there, I'm Rolando 

A developer who gets thrilled from creating great pleasing solutions that deliver user-friendly. Since I started programming with different tools and languages, I have focused my career on not just doing a job but delivering quality work, along with great interest in Javascript development with commercial experience in React Native, React Js, and Node Js.

I have been fortunate enough to have been involved in great projects that have allowed me to gain experience in web, mobile, and desktop environments.

I am a member of the AWS Community Builder program, which has led me to focus on serverless technologies with great interest in Aws amplify and DynamoDB.
On a personal level, kindness, respect, and empathy are my core principles.
